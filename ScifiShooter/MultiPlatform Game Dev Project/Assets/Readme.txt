Content:
 - 3 models of the robot
 - model of the stand for presentation
 - 2 basic textures and 1 normal map for each robot
 - 3 color variants of the texture and 1 normal map for the stand
 - additional textures for lighting effects
 - 2 versions of materials and shaders for robots and stands
 - several prefabs

Rigging robots: yes
Animation: no (I will add in the near future for a few animations for each robot)

For render and demo scenes, I use shaders from the standard asset set of Unity:

-Toon/Basic Outline.shader
-Legacy Shaders/Bumped Specular.shader
-Particles/Alpha Blended.shader

Robot models and textures are made by me and distributed free of charge, you can use them at your discretion and change as you like.

If you have any questions / suggestions / comments, etc., I will be happy to listen to you and try to help you!
